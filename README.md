## Lab overview and objectives  

In this lab, you use Amazon DynamoDB to store and manage menu information. Using databases, such as DynamoDB, simplifies data management because you can easily query, sort, edit, and index data. You will use both the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) and the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to work with DynamoDB.  

In upcoming labs, you will use application programming interface (API) calls from the caf√© website to dynamically retrieve and update data that's stored in a DynamoDB table.  

After completing this lab, you should be able to:

* Create a new DynamoDB table 
* Add data to the table 
* Modify table items based on conditions 
* Query the table 
* Add a global secondary index to the table
